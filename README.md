### **Design Choices**

Text 
​
#### **Fonts**
The main font I have chosen is the Lato font from Google Fonts.

- *Main Font* 

​  ```font-family: Lato font - from Google Fonts```

#### **Images**

</p>

<br>

#### **Colors**
The business uses red trucks for deliveries. This is a conscious branding exercise on their part. With all previous and current vechicles using the red and black color scheme.

The existing principal color scheme for the business is red, black and white.

<ol>
<li>This will help keep the screen bright and 'clean'</li>
<li>White offers a better contrast with the displayed information</li>
</ol>

To break this white colour I have added two colors, a green and a yellow, to style some container and card items and create some divisions on the screen.

## Wireframes
​
### **Site Layout**
​The site layout and mock-ups sketches were drawn free hand with pen and paper. The design of the program lead me to believe that a dashboard layout would suit the application best. Once I had preliminary sketches I researched some Bootstrap layouts which would suit and immediately moved to screen designed layout.

Preliminary wireframe sketches were made to create initial structure to the screen layout and the content.

<br>


<br>


As the sketches were rendered on screen with Bootstrap there were changes to the UX design and layout. Further slight style changes were made early in the design process following some live testing.

## Testing
​
## Functional Testing
The testing and result of same are located in a separate file​.

Testing results [here](TESTING.md)
<br>​
​

## Validator Testing

​
### <span style="color:#56a832; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px">CSS</span>
​
CSS was tested using [W3C CSS Validation Tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
​​<br>


​
### <span style="color:#ebd80c; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px">JavaScript</span>

The script.js file was tested with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) and showed no errors or warnings. 
​<br>


### <span style="color:#56a832; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px">HTML</span>
​
HTML files associated with this project were tested individually with [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and showed no errors or warnings. 
<br>


### <span style="color:#edb80c; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px">Python</span>
​
I have tested Python code in this project with [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/). The only error located in some of the Python files are a number of <span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight:bold">E501</span> errors which are <span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight:bold">line too long (a line greater than 79 characters)</span>.

I have decided not to alter the relevant lines to fit into 79-character restriction. 
- Having researched the options there is some mention of the effects on Django.
- I believe it would reduce of the readability of the code to chop lines.
